## Project Description

The aviation industry is experiencing its biggest crisis on record due to the Covid-19 pandemic,
which has resulted in drastically reduced passenger demand and widespread aircraft
groundings. The situation has been exacerbated by the lack of harmonisation of government
travel restrictions and quarantine requirements around the globe.

The industry is therefore desperate for meaningful insights into where, when and how
operations are likely to be restored as demand for leisure and business travel returns. Cirium is
the aviation industry’s analytics engine and so its key stakeholders are looking to us to help
them understand potential recovery scenarios.

Very large airlines, particularly in the US, have traditionally run on the so-called ‘hub & spoke’
operating model. This involves a system of connections to destinations around hub airports,
which are generally located at cities that are the largest or most economically viable in their
region. Under this model, airlines typically require travellers to make a stop at a hub to connect
between two cities, creating the spokes of the system. This approach provides efficiencies for
large carriers, while passengers only need to check in once – at their originating airport – and
collect their baggage at their ultimate destination. It also offers travellers more flight
frequencies due to multiple connection opportunities.

The second popular model of operation is point-to-point, which emphasises flying directly
3between the passenger’s origin and intended destination. The advantages to travellers are
faster flight times and reduced overall waiting times at airports. The development of smaller,
more fuel-efficient aircraft offering extended range capabilities has led to a rapid expansion of
point-to-point operations, spearheaded by a new generation of ‘low-cost carriers’ which
generally avoid routing their passengers through major connecting hubs.

With these points in mind, we would like you as Big Data analysts to work with Cirium’s global
flight schedules file as published on 15 th June 2019. This data set is the collective statement
from all airlines of which routes and aircraft they intended to fly from that day forward up to 12
months ahead (as the schedules constantly evolve, their reliability tends to decline beyond
approximately 3-4 months out). You can compare this file with the equivalent schedules file
published one year later, in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic.

What we are looking for is:

1. Any evidence that the big airlines started to alter their operating models due to the
pandemic. Were airlines still following the hub model, or were they adopting more of a
point-to-point model (the hypothesis being that travellers would want to reduce their
connection points and time at or near airports)? What conclusions can we draw when
comparing datasets?

2. Looking at the overall routes (origin & destination) for specific airlines (these can be the
same or different from 1.), can you identify scheduled routes that had been completely
removed in the June 15 th 2020 dataset? (For example, in 2019 London-Dubai was a
popular route, but in 2020 there were no airlines planning to operate between these
two airports.)

3. For the routes remaining, can you see a reduction in the number of airlines operating a
particular route? (For example, London to New York in 2019 had five airlines competing
daily, but in 2020 there were only two airlines competing.)
